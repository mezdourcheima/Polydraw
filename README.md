PolyDraw is a polygon editor, essential for efficiently creating simple and complex objects and illustrations. It is distinguished by its simplicity of use and is intended for everyone, including children, adults and professionals.
It has functions that are not obvious but can be quite useful.


## Utility 

With PolyDraw, it is very easy to : 
 - Draw simple shapes (circle, square, rectangle, triangle...).
 - Draw straight lines and open shapes with the pencil.
 - Make complicated objects (car, plane, house, cat...) mainly by 
 Performing Boolean operations between polygons (union, intersection, 
 subtraction...).
 - Change the color of an object and its outline.
 - Move and rotate objects.
 - Enlarge all or part of the area you are working on. 
 - Duplicate objects.
 - Use the ruler to take measurements.
 - Put the object in front or in the background.
 - Delete a single object or delete all.
 - Import and export images.
 - Save the project.
